# sat_obs_flood_vulnerability
This repository provides the code to reproduce findings of the paper:

Sauer, I.J., Mester, B., Frieler, K., Zimmermann, S., Schewe, J., & Otto, C. (2024). Limited progress in global reduction of vulnerability to flood impacts over the past two decades. Communications Earth & Environment DOI: 10.1038/s43247-024-01401-y

The code required to run the matching procedure of NatCatSERVICE with flooded area from the Global Flood Database (GFD) and to cut exposure for NatCatSERVICE and DFO impacts is provided in the folder ###matching.

The code required to reproduce the main findings is provided in the folder ###postprocessing. The data needs to prepared first by running the notebook summary_statistics_data_preparation.ipynb. Then data can be used for multivariate statistics and figures.

The folder ###postprocessing_alternative_mortality applies an additional mortality definition (methods). The folder ###postprocessing_alternative_pop generates vulnerabilities based on the GHSL population distribution instead of using GPW population.
